description: 'Wellington, Florida (March 30, 2016) – With the stunning equestrian estate of Tonkawa Farm as the stage, Week 12 of the Turf Tour welcomed some of Wellington’s top show jumping combinations as they battled it out on the turf in a number of divisions, from Young Horse classes and Schooling Jumpers to 1.30-1.35M classes and a challenging Grand Prix. Two days of nationally ranked show jumping were held March 23 and 25, 2016, as the second to last week of the 13-week circuit. With exceptional footing, gorgeous venues, a welcoming atmosphere, convenient scheduling, world-class amenities, and a range of competitors from amateurs to Olympians, the 2016 Turf Tour is setting new standards in show jumping competition.  Daniel Coyle, assistant to decorated Irish show jumper and Turf Tour regular Conor Swail, added a Grand Prix win to his 2016 resume aboard Ridley. One of only four other double clear rounds on the technical and competitive course, Coyle and the gelding owned by Susan & Ariel Grange of Lothlorien Farm blazed past the timers with all the rails in place in a jump off time of 40.963, almost three full seconds faster than the second place ride, Marie Hecart with Starlight. Leslie Howard and Up & Blue Chapelle finished third with a time of 43.666, while Brianne Goutal and Rebeca Ls rounded out the double clear rounds with a time of 45.827. The course, which featured a number of tricky distances, spectacular jumps, and near perfect grass footing, was host to quite a few top names over the course of the day including Olympic Gold Medalist Ben Maher, Candice King, Lauren Hough, and Paul O’Shea.'
